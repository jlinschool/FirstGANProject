# First GAN with Flowers
Just something for QTM 347 (Dr. McAlister) @ Emory that group found interesting and worthy of further exploration (very rudimentary). This project was heavily inspired by a few other ones. They will be cited in the course of this article.

# Introduction 
This project uses the TensorFlow.keras architecture and the 102 Category Flower Dataset ([link](https://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/data/flowers/102/index.html)) that was sourced from the web. In general, this project was a soft introduction to any sort of generative adversarial network and its capabilities in image generation as well as local behavior when it came to coding. 

# Dataset 
The dataset was limited to ~1000 for try 1 of our implementation and ~3000 for try 2 of our implementation. The link to the dataset is pasted in the previous section, and a tutorial on how to utilize this dataset is given from the website. The flowers were chosen as they were nicely scaled and simple images that would be relativeley easy to work with for a beginner. Some of the images will be displayed below:
