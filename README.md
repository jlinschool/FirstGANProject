# First GAN with Flowers
Just something for QTM 347 (Dr. McAlister) @ Emory that group found interesting and worthy of further exploration (very rudimentary). This project was heavily inspired by a few other ones. They will be cited in the course of this article.

# Introduction 
This project uses the TensorFlow.keras architecture and the 102 Category Flower Dataset ([link](https://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/data/flowers/102/index.html)) that was sourced from the web. In general, this project was a soft introduction to any sort of generative adversarial network and its capabilities in image generation as well as local behavior when it came to coding.
